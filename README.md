## The Problem This Solves

NinjaTrader is excellent for developing and analysing individual algorithms. You can backtest a single strategy, review its performance report, tweak parameters, and iterate. That part works well.

But the moment you're running two or more algos simultaneously — which most serious automated traders eventually do — NinjaTrader gives you no native way to answer the questions that actually matter at the portfolio level: How are these strategies interacting? Are they genuinely diversified, or are they all losing on the same days? If I have $50k to allocate, how much should go behind each one? What does my combined equity curve look like, and how bad could a drawdown get across the whole portfolio?

That gap is what AlgoScope was built to fill. It takes the trade exports you already have from NinjaTrader and lifts the analysis up to the portfolio level: correlations, combined drawdowns, optimal allocation, stress testing. Everything NinjaTrader's built-in reporting doesn't cover when you're running multiple strategies together.

---

## What It Does

Most traders run multiple automated strategies and have no way to know how they interact with each other — or how much capital to put behind each one. This tool answers that question.

Load your trade history CSVs, and the optimizer tells you:

- Which strategies are genuinely adding value versus overlapping each other
- What the best capital split would be according to 10 different mathematical methods
- How your portfolio would have performed in the worst conditions (Monte Carlo stress testing)
- Whether your chosen allocation actually holds up on data the optimizer hasn't seen (Walk-Forward Validation)

Everything runs in your browser. No account needed, no data sent anywhere, no cloud, no sign-up.

## How to Export Your CSV

### NinjaTrader
1. Open **NinjaTrader 8**
2. Go to **Account Performance**
3. Click the **Trades** tab *(important — not Executions or Orders)*
4. Right-click anywhere in the table → **Export to CSV**

### Tradovate
1. Log in to **Tradovate**
2. Go to **Account → History**
3. Click the **Orders** tab *(important — not Fills or Positions)*
4. Click **Export** → CSV

The tool auto-detects both formats. It also accepts NinjaTrader Performance Reports.

- **Risk-adjusted:** Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, Calmar ratio
- **Drawdown:** Max drawdown, max drawdown %, recovery factor
- **Tail risk:** Value at Risk (95% and 99%), CVaR / Expected Shortfall
- **Positioning:** Kelly Criterion (full, half, quarter), expectancy per trade
- **Distribution:** Skewness, kurtosis, Z-score, win/loss streaks

The optimizer runs all 10 methods simultaneously and shows the result of each in a side-by-side comparison table. Click any row to instantly apply that allocation.

![Optimiser — Methods & Allocation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meronmkifle/AlgoScope/main/Optimiser%20Part%201%20.png)

| Method | What It Finds |
|---|---|
| **Max Sharpe** | Highest return per unit of risk |
| **Max Sortino** | Highest return relative to downside volatility only |
| **Max Calmar** | Best return-to-drawdown ratio |
| **Min Drawdown** | Allocation with the smallest worst-case loss |
| **Risk Parity** | Each strategy contributes equally to total portfolio volatility |
| **Half-Kelly Sizing** | Capital allocation based on each strategy's Kelly Criterion, scaled to 50% |
| **Max Expectancy** | Highest expected profit per trade |
| **Max Profit Factor** | Best ratio of gross profits to gross losses |
| **Equal Weight** | Neutral starting baseline — same size for everything |

Use the interactive sliders to manually fine-tune your allocation and watch portfolio metrics update in real time.

The most important feature for avoiding overfitting.

The optimizer trains on the first 70% of your data, then tests the resulting allocation on the remaining 30% — data it has never seen. If the Max Sharpe allocation still outperforms equal-weight on the test set, that's a signal the allocation is robust, not just fitted to historical patterns.

Results: Out-of-sample Sharpe, P&L, max drawdown, split date, and a clear **Robust / Review** verdict.
